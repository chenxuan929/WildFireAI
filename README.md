# Predicting Wildfire Spread and Optimizing Firebreak Placement  

## 1. Fire Spread Forecasting  

For a given environment (whether randomly generated or derived from specific coordinates), predict the likelihood of fire spread from a starting cell based on factors such as:  

- **Vegetation Type / Fuel Type**  
- **Elevation**  
- **Moisture**  
- **Temperature**  
- **Wind Speed / Direction** (to be incorporated later)  

### **Markov Model Approach**  

#### **Environment Representation**  
The environment consists of an **n Ã— n** grid of cells, each representing a fixed area. The properties of each cell are derived from:  

- **Land Cover / Fuel Type**: Google Earth Engine, US Land Cover 
1. [US Physiography](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/CSP_ERGo_1_0_US_physiography)
2. [US NED Landforms](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/CSP_ERGo_1_0_US_landforms)
3. [GlobCover: Global Land Cover Map](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ESA_GLOBCOVER_L4_200901_200912_V2_3)
- **Elevation, Moisture, Temperature**: [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/elevation-api?utm_source=chatgpt.com#latitude=42.3287&longitude=-71.0854 )


#### **State of Each Cell**  
Each cell exists in one of three states:  
1. **Untouched**  
2. **Burning**  
3. **Burned**  

#### **Transition Probabilities**  
Fire spread transitions are modeled using the **Rothermel Model**, considering:  
- **Fuel Load**  
- **Surface-Area-to-Volume (SAV) Ratio**  
- **Fuel Depth**  
- **Dead Fuel Extinction (Moisture Content)**  
- **Heat Content (Temperature)**  

There are **7 main classifications** for fuel types. 

[Rothermel Model - Parameter Look Up By Fuel Type](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_series/rmrs/gtr/rmrs_gtr153.pdf) (pg. 26)

#### **Simulation Mechanism**  
- The agent will have access only to **directly adjacent cells**.  
- Fire spread probabilities are assigned based on transition probabilities.

## 2. Firebreak Optimization  

Using wildfire simulation runs (or multiple runs from different starting cells) within the same environment, the model will:  
- Analyze fire spread patterns  
- Suggest **optimal locations** for firebreak placement

## 3. End-to-End Workflow  

- **High-Level Design Choices**  
  - Environment selection  
  - Algorithm and model selection  
  - Fire spread simulation approach  

- **Team Responsibilities & Timeline**  
  - **Tentative division of work**  
  - **Soft deliverables and milestones**
